# py-chess

Chess implemented in python3.

AI implemented with negamax algorithm and basic 
piece weight evaluation function.
The game works with basic point and click actions,
and prints its move and the negamax evalution to 
terminal. You will have a choice to play with a 
friend, or as white or black.

Uses tkinter for graphical interface, so
make sure to use python3 for runs, or change
tkinter to Tkinter for python2.
